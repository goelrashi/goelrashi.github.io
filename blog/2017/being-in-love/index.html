<p>Isn’t being in love one of the strangest relationships? We all have our own personalize definition of what it really mean to us. Why is it so? Why there is no common defined statement that explains what actually love is and what it has in store for us if we proceed! It seems the answer to the most sought and yes, the silliest of the questions lies in the fact that ‘It’s all in our mind’.</p>

<p>No two human beings think on the same track. Everyone has own thought process and needs. Every person desires different things from life. And to get that balance we sought another soul to fill the gaps. But do we remain intact in the process we started? Most of us do not!</p>

<p>The reason being that while searching for the love we do remember the balancing process but after being in love, we unknowingly target our mirror image in our loved one. Everything that they do irritates us, as we believe that it is not the way to do certain things. But if we think another way around, if they behave in a manner we want them to then how they will be an altogether a different being! We just want to twist them to fit our own image mould. But while doing so we forget that we are actually trying to see our reflection in them.</p>

<p>Love is certainly not searching your own reflection but about seeing the other person as they are and loving them for it. Let them be free to be perfect in their own ways. In a simple way to understand this complicated version of love, it can be said that you may consider receiving a bunch of roses or hearing words like ‘forever’ as a gratitude for love but for your better half, the gesture of even peeling a fruit for you just because you don’t like doing it, may be a gesture of love! It’s all in our minds and our beliefs. Love cannot be measured by keeping the count of materialistic things, but it is measured by the actions of your loved one. Love is not always in complicated gestures; it is also in many small uncountable things that we usually forget to notice.</p>

<p>But that doesn’t mean you cannot contribute anything new to your relationship because love means acceptance! Again, every relationship has its own set of rules to live by and so they are flexible! The only catch here is never to forget while proposing a new rule that the thing you are talking about is not only absorbed with other’s mind but with their heart as well. Instead of being a critic, being an encourager helps. And not to forget that most of the ideas in any relationship are rejected because of the unsympathetic tone of voice. Compliments are the catalyst for people but the greatest compliment that you can give to a person you love is your undivided attention and your eagerness to listen what they feel. It is the easiest as well the rare gift we ever give to our loved ones.</p>

<p>Make your own rules for your relationship, as there are no generalize definitions that exist but the personalized ones that define you!</p>
